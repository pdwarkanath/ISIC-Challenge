    "In the United States, 5 million new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed every year.[1] Of these, melanoma which is the deadliest accounts for over 9000.[2] The diagnosis via visual inspection by patients and dermatologists is accurate only about 60% of the time.[3] Moreover, the shortage of dermatologists per capita has abetted the need for computer-aided methods to detect skin cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) has aggregated a large amount of publicly accessible dermoscopy images labeled with ground truth data. The ISIC 2018 challenge was divided into 3 tasks - Task1: Lesion Segmentation, Task 2: Lesion Attribute Detection and Task 3: Disease Classification. This report focuses on Task 3 i.e. classification of images into one of 7 possible classes."

That is obviously incorrect. In order to improve performance, we try several techniques such as data augmentation, oversampling low-frequency classes, weighted loss etc.\n",
